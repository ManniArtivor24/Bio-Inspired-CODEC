# BIO-Inspired Codec

# Overview
This project focuses on developing a Bio-Inspired CODEC using a custom Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to process image and sound data from videos. The SNN is designed with multi-layered encoding channels to compress and recover signals efficiently. By introducing noise in intermediate layers, the network is tested under realistic conditions, optimizing its performance using synaptic learning and spike metrics for error quantification.
